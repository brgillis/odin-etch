Description
-----------

This is a learning project developed as part of The Odin Project (www.theodinproject.com). The goal of this project is to use JavaScript to program an "etch-a-sketch"-like webpage. This page displays a grid of cells which will darken and stay darkened after hovered over. Clicking a cell will turn it black, and clicking again will undo this. This can also be accomplished by clicking and dragging across multiple cells.

The buttons at the bottom can be used to reset the grid or create a new grid of a different size (valid values are 1 through 100).
